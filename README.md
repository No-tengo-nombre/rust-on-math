# Rust on Math
*Rust on Math* (shortened to *rom*) is a package for Rust, which implements
different numerical methods used throughout science and engineering, as well as
important algorithms such as the FFT.

It is inspired by packages like *NumPy* and *SciPy*, which are available for the
Python programming language.
